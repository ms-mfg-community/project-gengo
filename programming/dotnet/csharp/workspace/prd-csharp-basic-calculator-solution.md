1.1 Document Information


**Version:** 1.0

**Author:** GitHub Copilot

**Date:** November 3rd, 2025

**Status:** Draft


1.2 Executive Summary

This document describes the requirements for developing a basic .NET 8 console calculator application with comprehensive xUnit testing. The calculator will support standard arithmetic operations and be designed with a focus on testability, maintainability, and proper error handling.


1.3 Problem Statement

Developers need a practical example of a well-structured .NET application that demonstrates:


Basic calculator functionality with support for essential arithmetic operations

Proper application structure with testable components

Implementation of unit testing with xUnit framework

Effective error handling and input validation

The solution will serve as both a functional calculator and a reference implementation for .NET best practices.


1.4 Goals and Objectives


Create a fully functional calculator application using .NET 8 and C#

Implement core arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /) using case expressions


Demonstrate proper C# coding practices including null handling, error management, and code organization


Refactor code from using case expressions to methods for better testability

Demonstrate incremental development by adding modulo and exponent operations

Provide comprehensive xUnit tests with different test approaches (fact, theory)

Enable a clean, interactive console experience with proper user feedback

Showcase proper solution structure with separate application and test projects


1.5 Scope


1.5.1 In Scope


PowerShell script to set up the solution and project structure

.NET 8 console application using top-level statements

Calculator core arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, exponent)

User input handling with proper validation

xUnit test project with comprehensive test coverage

Method refactoring for testability

Proper error handling and null safety

Documentation for both application code and tests


1.5.2 Out of Scope


GUI implementation

Advanced mathematical functions (logarithms, trigonometry, etc.)

Persistence of calculations

Scientific calculator features

Multi-language support

Calculator history feature


1.6 User Stories / Use Cases


As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic calculations with two operands so that I can quickly compute results

As a user, I want clear prompts and feedback during calculation so I can understand how to use the application

As a user, I want to perform multiple calculations in sequence so I don't have to restart the application

As a user, I want proper error handling so invalid inputs don't crash the application

As a developer, I want well-structured and tested code so that I can understand best practices in .NET development

As a QA tester, I want comprehensive unit tests so I can verify the calculator functions correctly

1.9 Assumptions and Dependencies


Development will use .NET 8 SDK

xUnit will be used as the testing framework

The application will use standard C# console I/O features


No external libraries beyond .NET Standard and xUnit are required


1.10 Success Criteria / KPIs


All specified calculator operations work correctly

Unit tests cover all arithmetic operations with multiple test cases

Code meets appropriate null safety standards for C#

Documentation is clear and comprehensive


1.11 Milestones & Timeline


Solution Setup

Create PowerShell script for initializing solution structure

Set up the .NET 8 console application and xUnit test project


Initial Implementation

Implement basic calculator operations with top-level statements

Build and test the initial version


Refactoring

Convert operations to testable methods

Add proper error handling and screen clearing

Make methods public for testing accessibility


Testing

Create comprehensive xUnit tests for all operations

Implement both fact and theory test approaches

Ensure all tests pass


Final Improvements

Add modulo and exponent operations

Document the code

Fix any remaining issues or warnings


Documentation

Update documentation

Create setup and cleanup scripts


1.12 Implementation Guidance


1.12.1 Solution Setup


Create a PowerShell script named `Set-DotnetSlnForCalculator.ps1` in "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)\programming\dotnet\csharp\workspace" that:

Creates a solution folder named `calculator-xunit-testing`

Sets up a new solution

Adds a console application project named `calculator`

Adds an xUnit test project named `calculator.tests`

Configures appropriate project references

Changes default file names from `Program.cs` to `Calculator.cs` and from `UnitTest1.cs` to `CalculatorTest.cs`

Execute the powershell script to create the solution structure


1.12.2 Calculator Implementation


Implement the calculator in `Calculator.cs` using top-level statements:

Prompt for first operand, second operand, and operator

Perform the appropriate arithmetic operation

Display the result

Ask if the user wants to perform another calculation

Handle user response to continue or exit


Fix null reference warnings using appropriate null handling techniques


1.12.3 Refactoring Steps


Convert each arithmetic operation into its own method for testability

Make methods public to allow testing from the xUnit project

Add screen clearing for a better user experience

Implement modulo and exponent operations

Add proper null handling to prevent exceptions


1.12.4 Testing Strategy


Create xUnit tests for each calculator operation

Use Fact tests for simple assertions

Use Theory tests with InlineData for testing multiple cases

Include test cases for edge conditions (like division by zero)

Implement tests for normal, edge, and error cases


1.12.5 Final Steps


Translate calculator code to Python for cross-language comparison

Write a cleanup script to reset the exercise

Complete documentation


1.13 Testing Requirements


All arithmetic operations must have unit tests

Each operation should have at least three test cases using Theory and InlineData

Tests should include edge cases and failure scenarios

All tests must pass before completion


1.14 Cleanup Procedure

Create a PowerShell script named `Remove-DotnetSlnForCalculator.ps1` to reset the exercise by:


Getting the repository root path

Appending the workspace path

Setting the current path to the target

Removing the calculator solution directory


1.15 Additional Learning Outcomes


Understanding .NET solution and project structure

Working with C# top-level statements


Implementing proper null handling in C# code


Writing effective xUnit tests with different techniques

Creating reusable setup and cleanup scripts

Translating C# concepts to other languages (Python)
