- Demonstrate proper C# coding practices including null handling, error management, and code organization
- Provide comprehensive xUnit tests with different test approaches (fact, theory)
- Enable a clean, interactive console experience with proper user feedback
- Showcase proper solution structure with separate application and test projects

## 1.5 Scope

## 1.6 User Stories / Use Cases

- As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic calculations with two operands so that I can quickly compute results
- As a user, I want clear prompts and feedback during calculation so I can understand how to use the application
- As a user, I want to perform multiple calculations in sequence so I don't have to restart the application
- As a user, I want proper error handling so invalid inputs don't crash the application
- As a developer, I want well-structured and tested code so that I can understand best practices in .NET development
- As a QA tester, I want comprehensive unit tests so I can verify the calculator functions correctly

## 1.11 Milestones & Timeline

1. Solution Setup
   - Create PowerShell script for initializing solution structure
   - Set up the .NET 8 console application and xUnit test project

2. Initial Implementation
   - Implement basic calculator operations with top-level statements
   - Build and test the initial version

3. Refactoring
   - Convert operations to testable methods
   - Add proper error handling and screen clearing
   - Make methods public for testing accessibility

4. Testing
   - Create comprehensive xUnit tests for all operations
   - Implement both fact and theory test approaches
   - Ensure all tests pass

5. Final Improvements
   - Add modulo and exponent operations
   - Document the code
   - Fix any remaining issues or warnings

6. Documentation
   - Update documentation
   - Create setup and cleanup scripts

## 1.12 Implementation Guidance

### 1.12.1 Solution Setup

1. Create a PowerShell script named `Set-DotnetSlnForCalculator.ps1` in the workspace directory that:
   - Creates a solution folder named `calculator-xunit-testing`
   - Sets up a new solution
   - Adds a console application project named `calculator`
   - Adds an xUnit test project named `calculator.tests`
   - Configures appropriate project references
   - Changes default file names from `Program.cs` to `Calculator.cs` and from `UnitTest1.cs` to `CalculatorTest.cs`

### 1.12.2 Calculator Implementation

1. Implement the calculator in `Calculator.cs` using top-level statements:
   - Prompt for first operand, second operand, and operator
   - Perform the appropriate arithmetic operation
   - Display the result
   - Ask if the user wants to perform another calculation
   - Handle user response to continue or exit

2. Fix null reference warnings using appropriate null handling techniques

### 1.12.3 Refactoring Steps

1. Convert each arithmetic operation into its own method for testability
2. Make methods public to allow testing from the xUnit project
3. Add screen clearing for a better user experience
4. Implement modulo and exponent operations
5. Add proper null handling to prevent exceptions

### 1.12.4 Testing Strategy

1. Create xUnit tests for each calculator operation
2. Use Fact tests for simple assertions
3. Use Theory tests with InlineData for testing multiple cases
4. Include test cases for edge conditions (like division by zero)
5. Implement tests for normal, edge, and error cases

### 1.12.5 Final Steps

1. Translate calculator code to Python for cross-language comparison
2. Write a cleanup script to reset the exercise
3. Complete documentation

## 1.13 Testing Requirements

- All arithmetic operations must have unit tests
- Each operation should have at least three test cases using Theory and InlineData
- Tests should include edge cases and failure scenarios
- All tests must pass before completion

## 1.14 Cleanup Procedure

Create a PowerShell script named `Remove-DotnetSlnForCalculator.ps1` to reset the exercise by:
1. Getting the repository root path
2. Appending the workspace path
3. Setting the current path to the target
4. Removing the calculator solution directory

## 1.15 Additional Learning Outcomes

- Understanding .NET solution and project structure
- Working with C# top-level statements
- Implementing proper null handling in C# code
- Writing effective xUnit tests with different techniques
- Creating reusable setup and cleanup scripts
- Translating C# concepts to other languages (Python)
